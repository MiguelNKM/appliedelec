                    <h3>1.1 Definition of Electric Field</h3>
                    <p>An electric field is a region around an electrically charged particle or object within which a force would be exerted on other charged particles or objects.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1.2 Electric Field Strength</h3>
                    <p>Electric field strength (E) is defined as the force (F) per unit charge (q): E = F/q. It is measured in newtons per coulomb (N/C) or volts per meter (V/m).</p>
                    
                    <h3>1.3 Electric Field Lines</h3>
                    <p>Electric field lines are imaginary lines used to visualize the direction and strength of an electric field. They always point from positive to negative charges and are perpendicular to equipotential surfaces.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1.4 Gauss's Law</h3>
                    <p>Gauss's Law relates the electric field flux through a closed surface to the enclosed electric charge. It is one of Maxwell's equations and is fundamental to electromagnetism.</p>

                    <p>A capacitor is an electrical component that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductors separated by an insulating material called a dielectric.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2.2 Capacitance</h3>
                    <p>Capacitance (C) is the ratio of the charge (Q) stored on one plate to the potential difference (V) between the plates: C = Q/V. It is measured in farads (F).</p>

            <h3>Problem 1: Electric Field Strength</h3>
            <p><strong>Question:</strong> A point charge of 2.0 × 10⁻⁶ C experiences a force of 0.4 N in an electric field. Calculate the electric field strength.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>We use the formula: E = F/q</li>
                <li>Where:
                    <ul>
                        <li>E is the electric field strength</li>
                        <li>F is the force experienced by the charge</li>
                        <li>q is the magnitude of the charge</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Substitute the values:
                    <br>E = 0.4 N / (2.0 × 10⁻⁶ C)
                    <br>E = 2.0 × 10⁵ N/C
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The electric field strength is 2.0 × 10⁵ N/C or 200 kN/C.</p>

            <h3>Problem 2: Capacitor Charge</h3>
            <p><strong>Question:</strong> A 470 μF capacitor is connected to a 12 V battery. Calculate the charge stored in the capacitor.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>We use the formula: Q = CV</li>
                <li>Where:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Q is the charge stored</li>
                        <li>C is the capacitance</li>
                        <li>V is the voltage across the capacitor</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Convert 470 μF to farads: 470 × 10⁻⁶ F</li>
                <li>Substitute the values:
                    <br>Q = (470 × 10⁻⁶ F)(12 V)
                    <br>Q = 5.64 × 10⁻³ C
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The charge stored in the capacitor is 5.64 mC (milliCoulombs).</p>

Key points about electric field lines include: 1) Direction: They show the direction of the electric field, always pointing from positive to negative charges. 2) Strength: The density of the lines indicates the strength of the field; closer lines mean a stronger field. 3) Visualization: They provide a way to visualize the invisible electric field in space. 4) Positive to Negative: They start on positive charges and end on negative charges, or extend to infinity for isolated charges. 5) Perpendicular: Electric field lines are always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces. 6) No Crossing: Field lines never cross each other, as this would indicate two directions for the field at a single point, which is impossible. 7) Equipotential Surfaces: Lines crossing equipotential surfaces at right angles. The significance of electric field lines lies in their ability to provide intuitive understanding of electric fields, helping in the analysis of complex charge distributions and in predicting the behavior of charged particles in electric fields.

                modelAnswer: "Electromagnetic cloaking is a technique that makes objects 'invisible' to electromagnetic waves, including visible light, radar, and other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The principle is based on manipulating the path of electromagnetic waves around an object, making it appear as if the waves passed through empty space. Key aspects include: 1) Metamaterials: Specially designed materials with properties not found in nature, capable of bending electromagnetic waves in unusual ways. 2) Wave Manipulation: The cloaking device guides waves around the object, reconstructing them on the other side as if they had passed through unimpeded. 3) Negative Refractive Index: Some cloaking techniques use materials with a negative refractive index to achieve the desired effect. Potential applications of electromagnetic cloaking include: 1) Military Stealth Technology: Making vehicles, ships, or aircraft invisible to radar. 2) Improved Antennas: Reducing interference between antenna elements in complex systems. 3) Medical Imaging: Cloaking medical devices to prevent them from interfering with imaging procedures. 4) Telecommunications: Reducing signal interference in densely packed communication systems. 5) Aesthetics in Architecture: Making structures like power lines or cell towers less visually obtrusive. 6) Acoustic Cloaking: Similar principles applied to sound waves for noise reduction. 7) Seismic Protection: Potentially guiding seismic waves around buildings or sensitive areas. 8) Privacy and Security: Creating 'invisible' zones for sensitive discussions or activities.
