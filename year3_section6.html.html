        <div id="work-solutions" class="tab-content">
            <h2>Work Solutions</h2>

            <h3>Problem 1: Cable Selection</h3>
            <p>A single-phase circuit is to supply a load of 8 kW at 230 V, 50 Hz. The circuit length is 30 meters. Select an appropriate cable size if the voltage drop should not exceed 2.5%.</p>
            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Calculate the current:
                    <br>I = P / V = 8000 / 230 = 34.78 A</li>
                <li>Calculate the maximum allowable voltage drop:
                    <br>Vdrop = 2.5% of 230 V = 0.025 × 230 = 5.75 V</li>
                <li>Using the formula: Vdrop = (2 × ρ × L × I) / A
                    <br>Where ρ (resistivity of copper) = 1.68 × 10^-8 Ω·m
                    <br>Rearranging to solve for A (cross-sectional area):
                    <br>A = (2 × ρ × L × I) / Vdrop
                    <br>A = (2 × 1.68 × 10^-8 × 30 × 34.78) / 5.75
                    <br>A = 6.12 mm²</li>
                <li>The next standard size up is 10 mm². This size will ensure the voltage drop is within limits.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Therefore, select a 10 mm² copper cable for this circuit.</p>

            <h3>Problem 2: RCD Selection</h3>
            <p>A domestic installation has a main supply rated at 100 A. Calculate the rating of the main RCD if it's required to disconnect within 40 ms for a touch voltage not exceeding 50 V.</p>
            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>The maximum earth fault loop impedance (Zs) for a 50 V touch voltage is:
                    <br>Zs = 50 V / IΔn
                    <br>Where IΔn is the rated residual operating current of the RCD</li>
                <li>For a 40 ms disconnection time, we typically use an RCD with IΔn = 30 mA</li>
                <li>Check if this meets the requirement:
                    <br>Zs = 50 / 0.03 = 1666.67 Ω</li>
                <li>This high impedance value means that a 30 mA RCD will provide adequate protection</li>
                <li>The RCD must also have a current rating equal to or higher than the main supply:
                    <br>Required rating ≥ 100 A</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Therefore, select a 100 A, 30 mA RCD for the main protection.</p>

            <h3>Problem 3: Earthing Calculation</h3>
            <p>Calculate the resistance of a 3-meter copper rod earth electrode with a diameter of 16 mm, driven vertically into soil with a resistivity of 100 Ω·m.</p>
            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Use the formula for rod electrode resistance:
                    <br>R = (ρ / 2πL) × [ln(4L/d) - 1]
                    <br>Where:
                    <br>R = Resistance of the earth electrode (Ω)
                    <br>ρ = Soil resistivity (Ω·m)
                    <br>L = Length of the rod (m)
                    <br>d = Diameter of the rod (m)</li>
                <li>Substituting the values:
                    <br>R = (100 / 2π×3) × [ln(4×3/0.016) - 1]
                    <br>R = (5.31) × [ln(750) - 1]
                    <br>R = (5.31) × [6.62 - 1]
                    <br>R = (5.31) × 5.62
                    <br>R = 29.84 Ω</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The resistance of the earth electrode is approximately 29.84 Ω.</p>

                keywords: ["safety", "fault current", "shock protection", "separate electrodes", "consumer", "supplier", "RCD"],
                modelAnswer: "Proper earthing is crucial in electrical installations for several reasons: 1) Safety: It provides a safe path for fault currents to flow, reducing the risk of electric shock. 2) Equipment Protection: It helps protect sensitive equipment from damage due to voltage spikes or lightning strikes. 3) Stability: It provides a reference point for voltage measurements and helps stabilize the electrical system. The TT earthing system is one of the main types of earthing arrangements. In this system, the power supplier's earthing (T) is separate from the consumer's earthing (second T). The neutral point of the transformer is connected directly to earth at the substation. At the consumer's end, all exposed conductive parts are connected to a separate earth electrode. This system relies on Residual Current Devices (RCDs) for fault protection, as the earth fault loop impedance can be relatively high. The main advantage of the TT system is that it's simple and doesn't require the power supplier to distribute an earth conductor. However, it requires effective RCD protection and regular testing of the earth electrode resistance."

                keywords: ["overcurrent protection", "fault clearance", "discrimination", "time-current curves", "upstream", "downstream", "reliability"],
                modelAnswer: "Selective coordination, also known as discrimination, is a crucial concept in electrical protection systems that ensures only the protective device closest to a fault operates to clear the fault, while upstream devices remain closed to maintain power to unaffected circuits. The importance of selective coordination lies in its ability to minimize the extent of an outage, enhance system reliability, and improve safety. Key aspects of selective coordination include: 1) Time-Current Coordination: Protective devices are selected and set so that the device nearest to the fault operates before upstream devices. This is typically achieved by setting longer time delays or higher current thresholds for upstream devices. 2) Types of Coordination: a) Full Selective Coordination: Ensures discrimination under all fault conditions. b) Partial Selective Coordination: Provides discrimination up to a certain fault current level. 3) Coordination Study: A detailed analysis of the electrical system is performed to determine the appropriate settings for each protective device. This involves examining time-current curves of all devices to ensure proper separation. 4) Benefits: a) Minimizes power interruptions to unaffected areas. b) Simplifies fault location and reduces downtime. c) Prevents unnecessary tripping of main breakers, which can affect critical loads. d) Enhances overall system reliability and safety. 5) Challenges: Achieving selective coordination can be complex, especially in systems with multiple voltage levels or parallel power sources. It may require compromises between protection sensitivity and coordination. 6) Modern Approaches: Advanced microprocessor-based protective relays allow for more sophisticated coordination schemes, including zone-selective interlocking and adaptive protection systems. These can provide faster fault clearance while maintaining selectivity. 7) Standards and Regulations: Many electrical codes now require selective coordination for critical systems, such as emergency and legally required standby systems. Implementing effective selective coordination requires careful planning, detailed system analysis, and sometimes the use of specialized software tools. It's an essential aspect of electrical system design that significantly contributes to the overall reliability and safety of power distribution systems."
