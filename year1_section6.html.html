                    <p>An electromagnetic field is a physical field produced by electrically charged objects. It affects the behavior of charged objects in the vicinity of the field.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1.2 Components of Electromagnetic Field</h3>
                    <p>An electromagnetic field consists of two components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Electric Field: Produced by stationary charges</li>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>1.3 Maxwell's Equations</h3>
                    <p>James Clerk Maxwell unified the theories of electricity and magnetism into a single theory of electromagnetism, described by four fundamental equations:</p>
                    <ol>

                    <h3>1.4 Electromagnetic Waves</h3>
                    <p>Electromagnetic waves are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light. They include radio waves, microwaves, visible light, X-rays, and gamma rays.</p>

            <h3>Problem 1: Induced EMF</h3>
            <p><strong>Question:</strong> A coil with 200 turns and an area of 0.04 m² is placed perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field. If the magnetic field changes from 0.5 T to 0.8 T in 0.1 seconds, what is the magnitude of the induced EMF in the coil?</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>We use Faraday's Law: EMF = -N * (dΦ/dt)</li>
                <li>Where:
                    <ul>
                        <li>N is the number of turns (200)</li>
                        <li>dΦ is the change in magnetic flux</li>
                        <li>dt is the time interval (0.1 s)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Calculate the change in magnetic flux:
                    <br>dΦ = A * (B2 - B1) = 0.04 * (0.8 - 0.5) = 0.012 Wb
                </li>
                <li>Substitute into Faraday's Law:
                    <br>EMF = -200 * (0.012 / 0.1) = -24 V
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The magnitude of the induced EMF is 24 V.</p>

            <h3>Problem 2: Self-Inductance</h3>
            <p><strong>Question:</strong> An inductor with a self-inductance of 0.5 H is connected to a circuit where the current changes at a rate of 100 A/s. What is the magnitude of the self-induced EMF?</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>We use the formula: EMF = -L * (dI/dt)</li>
                <li>Where:
                    <ul>
                        <li>L is the self-inductance (0.5 H)</li>
                        <li>dI/dt is the rate of change of current (100 A/s)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Substitute the values:
                    <br>EMF = -0.5 * 100 = -50 V
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The magnitude of the self-induced EMF is 50 V.</p>
