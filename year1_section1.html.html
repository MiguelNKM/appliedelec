            <h3>1. Protective Devices</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Electrical Protective Devices in Ghana</h4>
            <p>In Ghana, electrical protective devices are crucial for ensuring the safety of electrical installations and preventing accidents. The following devices are commonly used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rewirable fuse:</strong> A traditional protective device still used in some older installations in Ghana. It consists of a fuse wire that melts when excessive current flows through it.</li>
                <li><strong>Cartridge fuse:</strong> A more modern and reliable alternative to rewirable fuses, widely used in Ghanaian households and businesses.</li>
                <li><strong>Miniature Circuit Breaker (MCB):</strong> An automatically operated electrical switch that protects an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit. MCBs are becoming increasingly common in new installations across Ghana.</li>
                <li><strong>Residual Current Device (RCD):</strong> A life-saving device that quickly breaks an electrical circuit to prevent serious harm from an ongoing electric shock. The Ghana Electrical Wiring Regulations mandate the use of RCDs in certain installations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 Earthing of Premises in Ghana</h4>
            <p>Earthing is a fundamental safety system that provides a safe path for fault currents to flow to the ground, protecting both equipment and people from electrical hazards. In Ghana, the following aspects of earthing are important:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TN-C-S System:</strong> This is the most common earthing system used in Ghana, where the neutral and protective earth functions are combined in a single conductor in part of the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Earth Electrodes:</strong> Typically, copper rods are driven into the ground to provide a low-resistance path for fault currents. The high mineral content in much of Ghana's soil helps in achieving good earth resistance values.</li>
                <li><strong>Bonding:</strong> All exposed conductive parts of electrical installations must be bonded to the main earthing terminal to ensure safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Regular testing of earth resistance is crucial, especially considering Ghana's varied soil conditions from the coastal areas to the northern regions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. General Safety</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Electrical Safety Regulations in Ghana</h4>

                <li><strong>Energy Commission Act, 1997 (Act 541):</strong> This act established the Energy Commission, which oversees electrical safety standards in Ghana.</li>
                <li><strong>Factories, Offices and Shops Act, 1970 (Act 328):</strong> This act includes provisions for electrical safety in workplaces.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.2 Safe Working Procedures in the Ghanaian Context</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lock-Out/Tag-Out (LOTO) Procedures:</strong> While not as widely implemented as in some countries, LOTO is gaining importance in Ghana's industrial sector, particularly in mining and manufacturing.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):</strong> The use of appropriate PPE is crucial in Ghana's electrical industry. This includes insulating gloves, safety glasses, and flame-resistant clothing.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Tool Usage:</strong> Using the right tools for electrical work is emphasized in training programs across Ghana's technical institutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Working in Hot and Humid Conditions:</strong> Given Ghana's climate, special consideration is given to working safely in hot and humid conditions, including proper hydration and rest periods.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Fire Safety</h3>
            <h4>3.1 Types of Fire Extinguishers Available in Ghana</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dry Powder Extinguishers:</strong> Widely available and suitable for electrical fires. They are effective but can cause significant cleanup.</li>
                <li><strong>CO2 Extinguishers:</strong> Ideal for electrical fires and commonly found in offices and industrial settings in Ghana.</li>
                <li><strong>Foam Extinguishers:</strong> While not suitable for electrical fires, they are common in Ghana for other types of fires.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Extinguishers:</strong> Not suitable for electrical fires but commonly available. It's crucial to educate people about their inappropriate use on electrical fires.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3.2 Fire Safety in Electrical Environments in Ghana</h4>
            <p>Understanding common causes of electrical fires and prevention measures is crucial in the Ghanaian context:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overloaded Circuits:</strong> A common issue in many Ghanaian households and businesses due to the increasing use of electrical appliances.</li>
                <li><strong>Faulty Wiring:</strong> Substandard wiring materials and poor installation practices contribute to fire risks in Ghana.</li>
                <li><strong>Improper Use of Extension Cords:</strong> Educating the public on the proper use of extension cords is an ongoing challenge in Ghana.</li>

            <h3>Problem 1: Fuse Selection for a Ghanaian Household</h3>
            <p><strong>Question:</strong> A typical Ghanaian household has the following appliances: 2 fans (60W each), 5 LED bulbs (10W each), a refrigerator (150W), and a television (80W). Calculate the total current drawn and recommend an appropriate fuse rating for the main circuit.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Calculate the total power:
                    <br>(2 × 60W) + (5 × 10W) + 150W + 80W = 370W</li>
                <li>Calculate the current using P = VI, where V is 230V (standard voltage in Ghana):
                    <br>I = P / V = 370W / 230V = 1.61A</li>
                <li>The fuse rating should be the next standard size up from the calculated current.
                    <br>Standard fuse ratings in Ghana are typically 5A, 10A, 13A, etc.</li>
                <li>Therefore, a 5A fuse would be appropriate for this circuit.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Recommendation: Use a 5A fuse for the main circuit of this Ghanaian household.</p>

            <h3>Problem 2: Earthing Calculation for a Ghanaian Building</h3>
            <p><strong>Question:</strong> Calculate the resistance of an earth electrode for a building in Accra. The electrode is a copper rod 2.4 meters long and 15 mm in diameter, driven vertically into the ground. The soil resistivity in this area of Accra is measured to be 50 Ω-m.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>We use the formula: R = (ρ / 2πL) * (ln(4L/d) - 1)
                    <br>Where:
                    <br>R = Resistance of the earth electrode (Ω)
                    <br>ρ = Soil resistivity (50 Ω-m for this area in Accra)
                    <br>L = Length of the electrode (2.4 m)
                    <br>d = Diameter of the electrode (0.015 m)</li>
                <li>Substituting the values:
                    <br>R = (50 / (2π * 2.4)) * (ln((4 * 2.4) / 0.015) - 1)
                    <br>R ≈ 18.7 Ω</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The resistance of the earth electrode is approximately 18.7 Ω. This is within the acceptable range for Ghana, where the standard typically requires the earth electrode resistance to be less than 10 Ω for domestic installations and less than 5 Ω for industrial installations. However, for better safety, consider adding a second electrode in parallel to further reduce the resistance.</p>
